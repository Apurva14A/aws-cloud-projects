**An application where a user can create, delete or read their recipe.**

### Backend - EC2 to host your API and DynamoDB as data store for your recipes.

## Secnario 
   - You have spend a lot of your time creating recipes and reinventing desserts, and you usually write them down in a notebook. In parallel, you have started your own profile on social media, and you already have 800,000 followers that react to the photos of your dishes and ask you for the recipes. Because you are getting so popular, friends and family have started calling you "the chef" and ifeten ask you for some suggestions for specific recipes that they have tried in the past.
